# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results

## Overview
For this project, I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.


## Statistical Analysis Scope
- Bootstrapping sampling distributions
- P-value and Z-score calculation
- Logistic regression

## Tools
- Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, StatsModels, Scipy
- Jupyter Notebook

## Details
A company has developed a new e-commerce web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product.

The main goal of this project was to understand the results of an A/B test run by the website and provide statistical and practical interpretation on the test results.

## Conclusions
Generally, we do not have sufficient evidence to suggest that the new page results in more conversions than the old one, based on the probability, A/B test and regression.
